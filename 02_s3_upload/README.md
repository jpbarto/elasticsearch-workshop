## S3 Upload to Amazon Elasticsearch Lab

Based upon the blog post at https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/indexing-metadata-in-amazon-elasticsearch-service-using-aws-lambda-and-python/

Upgraded to work with Elasticsearch 6.0 and to use an environment variable named ``ES_HOST`` to hold the FQDN of the ES cluster.
